# Biomedical and clinical language model for Spanish üè•
Official repository of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) biomedical and clinical pretrained language models for Spanish.

## Models ü§ñ
We released our best models under the Apache License 2.0 to encourage the development of Spanish NLP applications in the biomedical and clinical domains. 

### Pretrained models:
We trained two models and make them available on HuggingFace' models hub at the following links:

 - [bsc-bio-es](https://huggingface.co/PlanTL-GOB-ES/bsc-bio-es): pretrained language model suitable for biomedical and clinical documents
 - [bsc-bio-ehr-es](https://huggingface.co/PlanTL-GOB-ES/bsc-bio-ehr-es): pretrained language model suitable for EHR documents and clinical notes

### Fine-tuned NER models:
We fine-tuned our models for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task and make the best models available on HuggingFace' models hub at the following links:

 - [bsc-bio-ehr-es-cantemist](https://huggingface.co/PlanTL-GOB-ES/bsc-bio-ehr-es-cantemist): NER model for tumor morphology on clinical cases
 - [bsc-bio-ehr-es-pharmaconer](https://huggingface.co/PlanTL-GOB-ES/bsc-bio-ehr-es-pharmaconer): NER model for substances, compounds and proteins on clinical cases

## Corpora üìÉ
The training corpora are composed of several biomedical corpora in Spanish, collected from publicly available corpora and crawlers, and a real-world clinical corpus collected from more than 278K clinical documents and notes. To obtain a high-quality training corpus while retaining the idiosyncrasies of the clinical language, a cleaning pipeline has been applied only to the biomedical corpora, keeping the clinical corpus uncleaned. Essentially, the cleaning operations used are:

- data parsing in different formats
  - sentence splitting
  - language detection
  - filtering of ill-formed sentences 
  - deduplication of repetitive contents
  - keep the original document boundaries

Then, the biomedical corpora are concatenated and further global deduplication among the biomedical corpora have been applied.
The results are a *clinical corpus* of about 91M tokens and a *biomedical corpus* of about 963M tokens. 
Eventually, the clinical corpus is concatenated to the cleaned biomedical corpus resulting in a medium-size biomedical-clinical corpus for Spanish composed of more than 1B tokens. The table below shows some basic statistics of the individual cleaned corpora:

## Evaluation ‚úÖ
The models have been fine-tuned on the the Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks using three clinical NER datasets, such as, [PharmaCoNER](https://zenodo.org/record/4270158), [CANTEMIST](https://zenodo.org/record/3978041#.YTt5qH2xXbQ) and ICTUSnet. We addressed the NER task as a token classification problem using a standard linear layer along with the BIO tagging schema. We compared our models with the general-domain Spanish [roberta-base-bne](https://huggingface.co/PlanTL-GOB-ES/roberta-base-bne), the general-domain multilingual model that supports Spanish [mBERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased), the domain-specific English model [BioBERT](https://huggingface.co/dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.2), and three domain-specific models based on continual pre-training, [mBERT-Gal√©n](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9430499), [XLM-R-Gal√©n](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9430499) and [BETO-Gal√©n](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9430499). The table below shows the F1 scores obtained:

| Tasks/Models | bsc-bio-es   | bsc-bio-ehr-es | XLM-R-Gal√©n        | BETO-Gal√©n   | mBERT-Gal√©n  | mBERT        | BioBERT      | roberta-base-bne |

| CANTEMIST    | 0.8220  | **0.8340**    | 0.8078 | 0.8153 | 0.8168 | 0.8116 | 0.8070  | 0.7875     |

## NER usage example ‚öóÔ∏è
The following example, show how to predict entities the [bsc-bio-ehr-es](https://huggingface.co/PlanTL-GOB-ES/bsc-bio-ehr-es) model fine-tuned on the PharmaCoNER dataset:

```python

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification, pipeline

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("PlanTL-GOB-ES/bsc-bio-ehr-es-pharmaconer")

model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("PlanTL-GOB-ES/bsc-bio-ehr-es-pharmaconer")

pipe =  pipeline(task='token-classification', model='PlanTL-GOB-ES/bsc-bio-ehr-es-pharmaconer')

sentence = 'Por el hallazgo de m√∫ltiples fracturas por estr√©s, se procedi√≥ a estudio en nuestras consultas, realiz√°ndose an√°lisis con funci√≥n renal, calcio s√©rico y urinario, calcio i√≥nico, magnesio y PTH, que fueron normales.'
results = pipe(sentence)

print(results)

```

```
# Expected output with the predicted entities:

[
  {'word': 'ƒ†calcio', 'score': 0.9963880181312561, 'entity': 'B-NORMALIZABLES', 'index': 24, 'start': 137, 'end': 143}, {'word': 'ƒ†calcio', 'score': 0.9965023398399353, 'entity': 'B-NORMALIZABLES', 'index': 29, 'start': 163, 'end': 169}, {'word': 'ƒ†magnesio', 'score': 0.996299147605896, 'entity': 'B-NORMALIZABLES', 'index': 32, 'start': 178, 'end': 186}, {'word': 'ƒ†PTH', 'score': 0.9950509667396545, 'entity': 'B-PROTEINAS', 'index': 34, 'start': 189, 'end': 192}
]

```

## How to fine-tune Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1) First, clone the project:

   `git clone https://github.com/PlanTL-GOB-ES/lm-biomedical-clinical-es/blob/master/README.md`

2) Set up a Python virtual environment and activate it

    `python3.8 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate`

3) Install all the required python packages in the virtual environment running the following line from the project main folder:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4) Finally, run the following command on the project main folder: `bash ner.sh [MODEL_NAME] [DATASET_NAME] [SEED]`, where

  - `[MODEL_NAME]`: HuggingFace' model name of the pretrained model you want to use.
  - `[DATASET_NAME]`: HuggingFace' dataset name of the NER dataset to use. Can be chosen from "PlanTL-GOB-ES/cantemist-ner" and "PlanTL-GOB-ES/pharmaconer", depending on the dataset you want to use.
  - `[SEED]`: the seed you want to use. This allows to reproduce the same results.

The `ner.sh` script fine-tune a pretrained language model for the NER task applying a linear classification head. By default, the fine-tuning run for 10 epochs with an evaluation on the development set at every epoch. The model achieving the best performance on the development set is selected as the final model and evaluated on the test set. The best trained model is store in a output path of the type `./output/model-$model_name/dataset-$dataset_name/seed-$seed` along with the checkpoints folders and the tensorboard data (inside the `tb` directory). 

For example, to fine-tune the [bsc-bio-ehr-es](https://huggingface.co/PlanTL-GOB-ES/bsc-bio-ehr-es) language model on the PharmaCoNER dataset, run the command: 

```
bash ner.sh PlanTL-GOB-ES/bsc-bio-ehr-es PlanTL-GOB-ES/pharmaconer 42
```

We compared them against general-domain and other domain-specific models for Spanish on three clinical NER tasks. As main results, our models are superior across the NER tasks, rendering them more convenient for clinical NLP applications. Furthermore, our findings indicate that when enough data is available, pre-training from scratch is better than continual pre-training when tested on clinical tasks, raising an exciting research question about which approach is optimal. Our models and fine-tuning scripts are publicly available at HuggingFace and GitHub.",
