# Biomedical and clinical language model for Spanish üè•
Repository of the biomedical and clinical pretrained language models for Spanish. 
For more details about the corpus, the pretraining and the evaluation, read our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03570) "_Carrino, C.

## Corpora üìÉ
The training corpora are composed of several biomedical corpora in Spanish, collected from publicly available corpora and crawlers, and a real-world clinical corpus collected from more than 278K clinical documents and notes. To obtain a high-quality training corpus while retaining the idiosyncrasies of the clinical language, a cleaning pipeline has been applied only to the biomedical corpora, keeping the clinical corpus uncleaned. Essentially, the cleaning operations used are:

- data parsing in different formats
  - sentence splitting
  - language detection
  - filtering of ill-formed sentences 
  - deduplication of repetitive contents
  - keep the original document boundaries

Then, the biomedical corpora are concatenated and further global deduplication among the biomedical corpora have been applied.
The results are a *clinical corpus* of about 91M tokens and a *biomedical corpus* of about 963M tokens. 
Eventually, the clinical corpus is concatenated to the cleaned biomedical corpus resulting in a medium-size biomedical-clinical corpus for Spanish composed of more than 1B tokens. The table below shows some basic statistics of the individual cleaned corpora:

## Usage example ‚öóÔ∏è

```python

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForMaskedLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("PlanTL-GOB-ES/roberta-base-biomedical-es")

model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("PlanTL-GOB-ES/roberta-base-biomedical-es")

from transformers import pipeline

unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model="PlanTL-GOB-ES/roberta-base-biomedical-es")

unmasker("El √∫nico antecedente personal a rese√±ar era la <mask> arterial.")

```

```

# Output

[
  {
    "sequence": " El √∫nico antecedente personal a rese√±ar era la hipertensi√≥n arterial.",
    "score": 0.9855039715766907,
    "token": 3529,
    "token_str": " hipertensi√≥n"
  }
]

## How to run Ô∏è‚ñ∂Ô∏è

First, clone the project.

Then, you will need to set up a virtual environment and activate it.

Install all the required python packages in the virtual environment running the following line from the project main folder: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Finally, run the following command on the project main folder: `bash ner.sh [MODEL_NAME] [DATABASE_NAME] [SEED]`, where

- [MODEL_NAME] is the name of the pretrained model you want to use.
- [DATABASE_NAME] can be chosen from "cantemist" and "pharmaconer", depending on the dataset you want to use.
- [SEED] is the seed you want to use. This allows to reproduce the same results.
